# REIMPLEMENT

This should be reimplemented with the idea that 

c(4) = c(3) + c(1) + c(2) - overlaps

This is doable if do
c(4) = c(2) + c(4-2)

c(7) = c(5) + [ GAPS IN BETWEEN ARE UNIQUE ]
That is, we can figure out which answers have been *FINALIZED* then use those
results to only do the gaps in between, so we don't accidentally do the work
multiple times and screw up our results.
